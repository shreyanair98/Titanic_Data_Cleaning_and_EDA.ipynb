This Jupyter notebook contains an exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset found within the seaborn library in Python.

The analysis includes reviewing the raw data, cleaning up the data, and creating plots/graphs to draw statistical inferences using Python, Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

The final statistical values and visualizations were used to draw key insights about the dataset.
